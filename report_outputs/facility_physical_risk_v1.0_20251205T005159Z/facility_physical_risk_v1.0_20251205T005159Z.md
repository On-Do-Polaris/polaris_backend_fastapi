# Physical Risk Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The company identifies three critical climate-related risks that warrant immediate attention. While the total estimated financial loss remains unspecified, the potential impact underscores the necessity for a robust strategic response. In alignment with best practices, the proposed overall strategic approach focuses on enhancing resilience and integrating sustainability into core operations. This proactive stance aims to mitigate risks while fostering long-term value creation for stakeholders. The commitment to transparency and accountability in ESG disclosures reflects the company's dedication to responsible business practices in an evolving regulatory landscape.

## Governance

The governance of climate-related risks and opportunities is integral to our organization's strategic framework. The Board of Directors maintains oversight of climate governance, ensuring alignment with our commitment to sustainability and risk management. A dedicated Climate Risk Management Committee has been established, comprising members from various departments including asset management, operations, and finance. This committee is charged with evaluating climate risks and opportunities, guiding the development of strategies that align with our long-term goals.

Management plays a critical role in the execution of climate governance. A cross-functional team has been designated to implement priority actions outlined in our climate strategy, including conducting facility-specific climate risk assessments and integrating sustainable energy solutions. Training programs aimed at enhancing awareness of climate change impacts among employees are also prioritized to foster a culture of sustainability across the organization. Regular monitoring of climate risk indicators will facilitate informed decision-making and continuous improvement in our climate resilience efforts.

To effectively allocate resources, budgetary considerations will focus on facilities identified as high-risk. This approach ensures that resources are distributed based on strategic priorities and the unique climate risks associated with each site. Our climate governance framework not only promotes accountability but also encourages proactive engagement in climate action, positioning the organization to mitigate risks while capitalizing on emerging opportunities in a rapidly evolving environmental landscape.

## Strategy

The organization's strategic vision centers on a comprehensive response to climate change, aiming to establish a sustainable asset portfolio while enhancing the climate resilience of its facilities. This approach prioritizes the identification and assessment of climate-related risks at each site, ensuring that resources are allocated effectively based on the specific vulnerabilities and strategic importance of each facility. By integrating sustainable energy solutions and fostering awareness through training programs, the organization seeks to minimize potential impacts arising from climate change.

To support this vision, a dedicated climate strategy team will be established, collaborating closely with asset management, operations, and finance teams. This team will oversee the formation of a climate risk management committee, which will guide the implementation of priority actions such as the promotion of nature-based solutions and the development of a robust data monitoring system. These initiatives are critical for tracking climate risk indicators, including energy consumption, greenhouse gas emission reductions, and participation rates in climate response training.

The implementation of these strategies will occur in phases: short-term actions (0-2 years) will focus on climate risk assessments and foundational data collection, while medium-term (2-5 years) efforts will emphasize the adoption of sustainable energy solutions and the execution of nature-based projects. Long-term goals (beyond 5 years) will involve comprehensive evaluations of climate resilience across all facilities, ensuring a continuous improvement process is in place to adapt to evolving climate challenges. This systematic approach not only enhances resilience but also positions the organization to seize emerging opportunities in a transitioning economy[1].

## Risk Management

Risk management within our organization follows a structured approach to identify, assess, and manage climate-related risks. We prioritize the identification of risks through comprehensive assessments tailored to each facility. This entails evaluating potential impacts from various climate scenarios, including extreme heat, drought, and flooding, which are pivotal to understanding the vulnerabilities within our operational landscape. By leveraging climate data and scenario analysis, our risk identification process ensures we remain proactive in addressing emerging threats to our assets and operations.

In the assessment phase, we employ a multi-faceted framework that categorizes risks based on their likelihood and potential impact. This framework is grounded in TCFD recommendations, allowing us to evaluate both physical risks—such as sea-level rise and water stress—and transitional risks related to regulatory changes and market shifts. The results of these assessments guide our strategic vision, enabling us to allocate resources effectively and prioritize actions that enhance our resilience against climate impacts.

Management of identified risks involves the implementation of targeted strategies to mitigate potential adverse effects. We are committed to integrating sustainable practices across our operations, including the adoption of renewable energy solutions and nature-based strategies. Additionally, we foster a culture of awareness through educational programs that equip employees with the knowledge to navigate climate risks effectively. The establishment of a dedicated climate risk management committee ensures that our approach remains dynamic and responsive to evolving environmental conditions and regulatory landscapes.

To monitor our progress, we have developed key performance indicators (KPIs) focused on energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions reduction, and participation in climate literacy training. Regular reviews of these metrics will inform our ongoing strategy, ensuring alignment with our overarching goal of building a sustainable asset portfolio and enhancing the climate resilience of all facilities. By taking a proactive stance in risk management, we aim to safeguard our operations while contributing positively to the environment and society at large.

## Metrics and Targets

To effectively track and assess our climate-related performance, we have established a comprehensive framework of metrics and targets aligned with the TCFD recommendations. Our key performance indicators (KPIs) revolve around critical areas including carbon emissions, energy consumption, and water management. We will monitor Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions to provide a holistic view of our carbon footprint. Additionally, we aim to enhance our energy efficiency by increasing the percentage of renewable energy used in our operations, thereby reducing total energy consumption over the coming years.

In line with our strategic vision to build a sustainable asset portfolio, we have set measurable targets for the short, medium, and long term. Over the next two years, we will conduct climate risk assessments and initiate training programs, establishing a baseline for our performance metrics. By 2025, we aim to implement sustainable energy solutions and natural-based strategies across our facilities, with a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20%. Our long-term goal, set for 2030 and beyond, is to achieve a 50% reduction in emissions while enhancing the climate resilience of all sites.

Monitoring and reporting will occur through a structured framework that includes regular reviews of our KPIs, ensuring accountability and transparency in our climate initiatives. We will adjust our resource allocation based on the identified climate risks at each facility, prioritizing investments that align with our sustainability objectives. This dynamic approach allows us to remain agile in our response to climate challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities in the transition to a low-carbon economy.
