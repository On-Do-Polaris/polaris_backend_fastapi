# Physical Risk Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The company identifies three primary climate-related risks that necessitate immediate attention and strategic alignment. While the estimated total financial loss remains undetermined, the potential impact on operations and reputation underscores the urgency of addressing these risks. In response, the proposed strategic approach emphasizes a comprehensive framework to mitigate vulnerabilities and enhance resilience. This strategy aims to integrate sustainability into core business operations, thereby positioning the company to thrive in an evolving regulatory landscape and meet stakeholder expectations. Through proactive measures, the company seeks to safeguard its assets and ensure long-term sustainability.

## Governance

The governance structure for managing climate-related risks and opportunities is pivotal to our organization’s sustainability strategy. The board of directors holds primary responsibility for overseeing climate governance, ensuring that climate-related matters are integrated into the overall corporate strategy. This includes evaluating the effectiveness of our climate initiatives and ensuring alignment with regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations. The board regularly reviews key performance indicators related to climate performance and adjusts strategies as necessary to mitigate risks and leverage opportunities. 

Management plays a vital role in implementing the board's directives and operationalizing climate strategies across the organization. A dedicated climate committee, comprising cross-functional leaders, monitors climate risks and opportunities, reporting directly to the board. This committee is tasked with assessing the potential impacts of climate scenarios on business operations and financial performance. Regular training and updates are provided to staff to foster a culture of climate awareness and preparedness, ensuring that all employees understand their roles in achieving our climate objectives.

Furthermore, our governance framework emphasizes transparency and accountability. We commit to regular disclosures regarding our climate-related strategies and performance metrics, adhering to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. This approach not only enhances investor confidence but also aligns with our broader ESG commitments, reinforcing our dedication to sustainable business practices[1].

## Strategy

To effectively address climate-related risks, our organization has developed targeted strategies based on identified vulnerabilities. For extreme heat, we aim to enhance building energy efficiency and improve temperature control systems. This includes upgrading HVAC systems to better cope with elevated temperatures, installing insulation on external walls, and implementing an emergency response plan for cooling during high-temperature events. The projected cost for these enhancements is approximately 100 million KRW, with anticipated annual benefits of around 200 million KRW through energy cost savings and enhanced facility safety[2].

In response to extreme cold, our strategy focuses on improving insulation performance within our buildings and creating robust emergency response plans to prioritize employee safety. This involves the installation of double-glazed windows and additional insulation materials on roofs and walls. The expected investment for these upgrades is around 1.5 billion KRW, with potential annual savings of 300 million KRW from reduced energy costs and prevention of facility damage[3].

Water stress management is addressed through a comprehensive strategy that includes monitoring water usage, implementing recycling measures, and optimizing operational procedures for water conservation. The estimated cost for establishing this integrated management strategy is about 500 million KRW, with expected annual savings of 100 million KRW from reduced water consumption[4]. These strategies collectively aim to enhance resilience against climate-related impacts, ensuring the sustainability and operational continuity of our organization.

## Risk Management

The organization employs a robust risk management framework to identify, assess, and manage climate-related risks in alignment with TCFD recommendations. This framework includes a comprehensive analysis of physical risks, categorized into extreme heat, extreme cold, water stress, and other climate-related hazards. The assessment of these risks is based on quantitative metrics derived from climate scenarios, particularly the SSP245 scenario, which highlights significant impacts from extreme temperatures and water scarcity[5].

Risk identification involves analyzing potential climate impacts on operational assets and supply chains, focusing on vulnerabilities such as aging infrastructure and inadequate resilience measures. The top three identified risks—extreme cold, extreme heat, and water stress—are evaluated based on their likelihood and potential financial implications. Each risk is assigned a severity level, with extreme cold and extreme heat classified as high risks, indicating a pressing need for targeted mitigation strategies[6].

To address these risks, the organization has developed specific strategies. For extreme cold, the focus is on improving building insulation and establishing emergency response plans to ensure staff safety. In terms of extreme heat, enhancing energy efficiency and upgrading temperature control systems are prioritized. Water stress management includes implementing water conservation policies and investing in recycling systems[7]. These strategies are accompanied by cost-benefit analyses to ensure financial viability, demonstrating a commitment to proactive risk management in the face of climate challenges.

## Metrics and Targets

To effectively monitor and manage climate-related risks and opportunities, our organization employs a comprehensive set of metrics and targets aligned with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework. Key performance indicators (KPIs) include carbon emissions categorized into Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3, along with energy consumption metrics such as total energy use and the percentage derived from renewable sources. Water-related metrics, including water withdrawal, consumption, and recycling rates, are also integral to our performance assessment.

Our targets are strategically set to align with both regulatory expectations and industry best practices, aiming for significant reductions in carbon emissions by 2030. Specifically, we target a 30% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from 2024 levels by 2030, while also committing to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Additionally, we aim to increase the proportion of renewable energy in our total consumption to 50% by 2025. These targets reflect our commitment to mitigating climate impacts and enhancing resource efficiency across operations.

Monitoring progress towards these targets involves regular assessments and reporting, ensuring that our strategies remain adaptive to evolving climate scenarios, including SSP245 and other relevant pathways. This approach not only supports our sustainability objectives but also provides transparency for investors and stakeholders, reinforcing trust and accountability in our climate governance [8].
